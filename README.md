profitability, customer behavior, and regional performance in order to support
better business decision-making.

## Summary of Insights

### Category Performance
- Technology and Copiers are the strongest profit contributors
- Furniture and Tables consistently generate losses

### Regional Performance
- West and East regions outperform Central and South
- California and New York lead profitability
- Texas and Ohio are major loss-driving states

### Customer Behavior
- A small percentage of customers generate most of the profit
- Several customers have high revenue but result in losses

---

## Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

Customers were grouped based on:
- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Order Frequency  
- Discount Usage  
- Profit Margin  

### Customer Groups

### 🔴 Cluster 0 — Loss / High-Risk Customers
Low or negative profit due to heavy discounts and weak margins.

### 🟡 Cluster 1 — Average Customers
Stable revenue with moderate profitability.

### 🟢 Cluster 2 — High-Value Customers
Customers contributing the majority of overall profit with strong margins.

> Retaining high-value customers delivers more impact than increasing sales volume.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Reduce discounting for loss-making customers
- Focus retention strategies on high-value customers
- Improve pricing policies in loss-prone states
- Optimize product categories based on profitability
